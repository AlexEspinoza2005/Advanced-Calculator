## Solutions Implemented

### List of Features and Fixes:

1. **No Error When Raising to Power of 0:**
   - Fixed the issue where raising a number to the power of 0 would cause errors or unexpected results. Now, any number raised to the power of 0 will correctly return 1.

2. **Division by Zero Error Handled:**
   - Prevents the calculator from crashing or displaying incorrect results when attempting division by zero. A user-friendly error message is shown instead.

3. **Correct Handling of Negative Numbers:**
   - Ensures that negative numbers are handled correctly in all arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. **Handling Decimal and Integer Calculations:**
   - Fixed bugs where decimal points were not properly supported in operations. Now, the calculator can handle both decimal and integer calculations seamlessly.

5. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division all work without issues, including negative numbers and decimals.

6. **Correct Implementation of Trigonometric Functions:**
   - Fixed issues with the trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) to ensure they provide accurate results for both degrees and radians.

7. **Switch Between Degrees and Radians:**
   - Implemented a feature to toggle between degrees and radians for trigonometric calculations. Users can now switch modes easily without errors.

8. **Conversion Between Binary, Hexadecimal, and Decimal:**
   - Corrected the conversion process between binary, hexadecimal, and decimal systems. The calculator now accurately converts between all three without crashing or providing incorrect results.

9. **Save and Clear Functionality:**
   - Implemented the ability to save and store multiple calculation results. Users can now save a value and recall it later, and also clear the stored values when needed.

10. **Dark Mode and Light Mode Toggle:**
    - Fixed visual issues with the dark mode feature. The application now supports both dark and light modes, ensuring readability and comfort in any lighting environment.
